Productivity Extension
=============

Introduction
-----
This program is a Google Chrome extension in which it will help the user be more productive while using **Google Chrome**.

I wrote the program in `HTML`, `JavaScript`, and `CSS`. `HTML` files are for the appearance of the extension. `CSS` files are for styling of the HTML files. And, `JavaScript` files are for the functionality of the program.

Features
-----
The __popup__ will contain two buttons "Start" and "Settings". Clicking on "Start" will activate the productive state, which will block websites that are part of the blocked list. Clicking on *Settings* would create a new tab with the `HTML` page for the settings.

When the user first starts the extension, it will block the major social media websites (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram). If the user wants to block more websites to be productive, the user can change the blocked list through the __Settings__ page! In this page, the user can add more websites for the extension to block. But it can also remove websites from the list!

This program also includes a __timer__ (counting up) so the user would feel more motivation to keep being productive while working.

When the user goes to a page that should be blocked. The active tab redirects them to the __blocked page__. It basically only shows that the page is blocked and the user can just go back to the last page.

Inspiration
-----
While I was studying for college courses and working on other projects, I had trouble staying focused. There are times where I go to social media websites when I had assignments that require full attention. Because of this experience, I decided to create a Google Chrome extension that would assist me in staying on track.
